<h1 id="saaqclic-the-gallant-report-and-what-comes-next">SAAQclic: The Gallant Report and What Comes Next</h1>
<p>The release of Commissioner Denis Gallant's final report on February 16, 2026 marks a turning point in one of Quebec's most expensive and damaging government technology failures.</p>
<h2 id="the-scale-of-the-failure">The Scale of the Failure</h2>
<p>The SAAQclic project was launched in February 2023 despite clear warning signs it was not ready. The system, designed to modernize vehicle registration and driver's license services for Quebec's Societe de l'assurance automobile du Quebec (SAAQ), collapsed almost immediately under public use.</p>
<p>The total estimated cost has reached $1.1 billion by 2027 -- a $500 million overrun on the original budget.</p>
<h2 id="karl-malenfant-speaks-before-the-report-lands">Karl Malenfant Speaks Before the Report Lands</h2>
<p>On February 11, former VP of IT and project lead Karl Malenfant held a preemptive news conference to defend his reputation ahead of the report's release.</p>
<p>Malenfant rejected the "fiasco" label, arguing the system "works" and that the $1.1 billion cost estimate conflates unrelated items. He claimed to be the victim of a "character assassination" campaign. He also spread the responsibility to IBM/LGS consultants and the SAAQ Board of Directors, who he says approved the February 2023 launch despite internal warnings.</p>
<h2 id="criminal-activity-in-the-wreckage">Criminal Activity in the Wreckage</h2>
<p>While the political battle plays out, law enforcement has been active. On February 9, UPAC -- Quebec's anti-corruption unit -- arrested former SAAQ employee Francois Dagenais. He is accused of using unauthorized system access to alter data for acquaintances between 2023 and 2024.</p>
<h2 id="what-the-gallant-report-is-expected-to-address">What the Gallant Report Is Expected to Address</h2>
<p>After 75 days of hearings and review of more than 200,000 documents, Commissioner Denis Gallant's report is expected to answer:</p>
<ul>
<li>Who made the final decision to launch a system that was not ready</li>
<li>How the budget grew by $500 million without adequate oversight</li>
<li>What role IBM/LGS played in the failed deployment</li>
<li>Whether accountability mechanisms within the SAAQ and the CAQ government were adequate</li>
</ul>
